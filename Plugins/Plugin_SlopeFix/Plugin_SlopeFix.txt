(Exclusively for the use in TDR at the moment, do not use in other projects!)

This plugin enables Lara to slide down slopes according to their true sloping direction by enabling this option with the CUST_TRUE_SLOPES command.

Another feature of this plugin is an improved version of slope turning with the left and right keys, which can also be enabled with the CUST_SLOPE_TURNING command. You can adjust desired parameters about the slope turning in the further fields of this command.

This plugin is NOT finished and it still may be ridded with bugs. If you see something weird or unpredicted, please inform me (Krystian) on Discord or wherever.
