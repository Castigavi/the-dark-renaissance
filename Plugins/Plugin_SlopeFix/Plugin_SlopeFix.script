<START_CONSTANTS>
CUST_TRUE_SLOPES:1 ;Syntax: Customize=CUST_TRUE_SLOPES, ENABLED/DISABLED>>Allows to enable NG diagonal slopes in TRNG. Normally, when you slide down diagonal slopes in classic Tomb Raider games, Lara will still slide down in one of the orthogonal (NSWE) directions. This doesn't look very realistic, however. By enabling this feature, the actual (geometric) sloping direction of the slope is established as the sliding direction.>>Note: NG slopes are disabled by default.
CUST_SLOPE_TURNING:2 ;Syntax: Customize=CUST_SLOPE_TURNING, ENABLED/DISABLED, TurningMaxAngle, TurnFrameSpeed, RecoilFrameSpeed>>Allows to enable turning on slopes with the left and right keys.>>NOTE: Slope turning is DISABLED by default. As with all Customize scripts, you can omit any last fields and they will be set to their respective default values.>>TurningMaxAngle>---------------->This is the maximum angle to which Lara can turn in both directions, relative to the current facing/slope orient and she will maintain this direction as long as the left/right key is pressed. By default it is set to $2000 (8192 in decimal) if you type IGNORE, but any value can be set in the $1 to $4000 range ($4000, i.e. a quarter turn is the maximum accepted value, any higher values will be lowered to this).>>TurnFrameSpeed>--------------->This field sets the speed at which Lara will turn to the TurningMaxAngle facing. It is the number of in-game FRAMES it will take to reach TurningMaxAngle. Default value is 20.>>RecoilFrameSpeed>----------------->This field sets the recoil, or the speed at which Lara returns to the main facing after releasing the left/right key. Similarly to the previous field, the value is the number of frames needed to return to the original facing. However, there is also a special value 0 which will disable recoil entirely, so Lara won't return if you let go of the keys. Default value is 20.
