Plugin version is 1.0.0.0.
Useable TRNG is 1.3.0.7 or higher.

Other plugins needed: none.

This plugin contains several new executable triggers and condition triggers, for different features.

Notes:

- Several new things in this plugin is also available with easier or complex triggering and scripting, in variable and memory zone based setups, using only trng.dll.
However, any variable mentioned there, are NOT used in these new triggers. This plugin is variable-free for level builders!
- Several triggers hosting Moveable objects are not Action triggers but Flipeffects. Believe me, I had a good reason to do that, this is not a bug or an error, triggers like that work properly only this way.
- Possible (probably unfixable) bugs are mentioned in the descriptions. (See NG Center/Reference or NGLE/Set Trigger Type/Trigger's Remark.)
- Many triggers (controlling objects) of this plugin has a limitation: only one or a few objects can be used with that feature at the same time. I did that limitation because they need some extra memory:

a, It is a continuous feature, we need to execute it again and again, or else the effect will be lost. Or
b, New savegame data is needed for this feature.

And I created that extra memory only for one/a few numbers of objects.
- It seems the best or sometimes the only way to use some condition triggers is if you use them as GlobalTrigger conditions, not placing them in the map. (But maybe you will be more lucky than me when you test them in the map, that is why they are not only GlobalTrigger conditions.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatical bug fixes:

- Bug description: the Seth Blade trap will be reactivated when a savegame has been loaded.

Note:
This fix works only if the OCB is negative. (Because it is meaningless with a positive OCB.)
I mean, it is not really known, but Seth Blades are working not only with negative OCB numbers, but positive OCB numbers as well:

a, As you know, a negative OCB number means the trap will start moving in a time which is defined in the OCB number (as tick frames), and, after that, the trap won't move any more.
b, A positive OCB number means the trap will start moving in a time which is defined in the OCB number (as tick frames), and, after that, the trap will start moving again (according to that time).

An antitrigger means a pause in both cases.

- Bug description: the Drive/Reverse and speedcounter sprites are enabled even if Lara is not in the jeep.

Note:
Yes, the jeep also has a (useable!) speedcounter sprite if there also is a motorbike in the WAD.
