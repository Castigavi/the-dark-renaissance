------------------------------------

FEATURES IN THE PLUGIN:


.....................

Remove/restore the shadow of an enemy type, or Lara, or check it:

F585:Enemy. Remove the shadow of <&> enemy type (or Lara) for (E) case 
F586:Enemy. Restore the shadow of <&> enemy type (or Lara) for (E) case 
C115:Enemy. The shadow of <#> enemy type (or Lara) is (E) seeable/removed

.....................

An "ultimate" scripted tool to handle numerical variables, even with new variables, if Paolone's Local Long Alfa, Global Short Beta1 etc. variables and their triggers are just not enough and/or seeming complex for your game.
Notable extra features: floating values and data transport between the levels and the title are supported!

F587:Variables. Execute <&> operation

Print a Diagnostic screen for new variables or "old" memory zone fields.
Notable extra feature: a spectacular display if a bit is set or cleared.

F588: Variables. Diagnostic. (E) Enable/disable <&> diagnostic

Print new variables or "old" memory zone fields in the log:

F589:Variables. Log. Print <&> value in the log
F590:Variables. Log. Remove <&> value from the log

Print new variables or "old" memory zone fields, in your custom text, on the screen:

F591:Text. (E) Print/remove custom text and variable with <&> parameters

Note:
F591 is useable even without printing variables/fields. Which is good, because special F591 features (like eg. variablke-based position) can be used even for printing texts without variables/fields.

Examine new variables or "old" memory zone fields, if they are equal/bigger/smaller than another number:

C114: Variables. Examine <&> relation

Note:
Prints are gone with static/flyby cameras, this will fix it:

F598:Camera. <&> Start/stop fixing "text/image/sprite is missing from static/flyby camera screen" bug

.....................

An extended version of the exportable "FINISH trigger" (trng.dll F82) to perform a level jump even to LARA_START_POS objects - just like in the case of the classic FINISH trigger:

F592:Finish. Load <&>level to (E) Lara

.....................

Sprite features:
- A better control for sprites, instead of of trng.dll PARAM_SHOW_SPRITE, in some meanings, i.e. F595 is able to place the sprite even in variable-based positions and/or to place/remove it by degrees, fading it in/out:

F595:Sprite. (E) Show/hide sprite with <&> parameters

- "Raindrops on the camera lens" feature, imitated with sprites on the screen in rain, snow or close to waterfalls:

F596:Sprite. (E) Enable/disable "raindrops on lens" effect with <&> parameters

Note:
- F596 is also useable in the case of some special setups, like marks of splashing blood "on the lens" etc.
- See F598 above to fix the missing sprites on static/flyby camera screens.

.....................

Force dripping on Lara - just like when she is coming out of water:

F597:Effect. <&> Start/stop making Lara dripping for a while

Note: F596 makes possible to mix raindrop and drip features.

.....................

You can try what usually is impossible, i.e. execute a trigger during menus or loadscreens (even if it is a specific menu/loadscreen):

F593:TriggerGroup. Perform trigger in menu mode with <&> parameter

As an option, you can also add a keyboard key to that trigger, so the trigger will be executed in that menu/loadscreen only if you hit that key.

Additional features:

- Leveljump loadscreen in F593 can be detected only if you use F592 (see above) as a "Finish" trigger.
- Backup savegame loadscreen in F593 can be detected only if you use F594, instead of the same trigger of trng.dll F98:

F594: Backup. Restore (load) the <&> backup file in (E) way (for menu mode)

- Triggers drawing things on the screen cannot work in menu mode if they are trng.dll triggers, choose the triggers of the plugin:

a. F591 to print text, see above (even if you don't want to print memory zone fields or new variables),
b, F595 to show sprites, see above (even if you don't want to change the sprite position in variables), 

"Images" Flipeffect are useless to show images in these situations, without errors. Unfortunately I could not reproduce a similar "Images" trigger to do it without errors. That is why your only chance to show images under menus is still a Customize= CUST_BACKGROUND Script command.
- On the other hand, the sound and audio flipeffects of trng.dll will work perfectly now.

.....................

The identification of the previous level could be useful if there are different Finish triggers in different levels to load Lara to the current level:

C113: Finish. The previous level ID is <#>

Note:
It is also useful to check some special cases, eg. if you have come to the title from a level, by the death of Lara etc.

.....................

You can check a few parameters of the actual (chase, look, combat, static, flyby) camera (like room, position etc.):

C112: Camera. The actual camera has <#> parameters

.....................

An alternative version to simply enable/disable triggers with a TRIGGER_TRIGGERER object. This time what you activate/deactivate is not a TRIGGER_TRIGGERER, but a Condition trigger. This is useful if the trigger that you want to enable/disable has a (much) bigger area than one sector, or if it is not a map trigger, but a trigger scripted:

F599: Trigger management. (E) Activate/deactivate condition, signed with <&>
C111: Trigger management. This condition with <#> sign has already been activated

.....................

If you want something to be activated when a few switches of the same switch type has already been used in the required order:

F600: Lara. (Holds) (E) Establish/remove <&> switch sequence
F601: Lara. (Holds) Reset <&> switch sequence
C110: Lara. (Holds) Lara uses the switches of <#> sequence

Note:
Successfully tested only in LEVER_SWITCH slot for the time being.
